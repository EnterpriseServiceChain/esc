Message is a HEADER with unordered list of pairs of <KEY, VALUE>
HEADER is TOKEN
KEY is TOKEN
VALUE is single TOKEN, vector of TOKENs or 2 dimensional array of TOKENs
TOKEN is a string with control characters escaped, by "\"=0x5C
control characters are 
  0x0A "line feed" "\n"   
  0x2B "+"   
  0x2C ","

HEADER								# header is always on first line
KEY1=value1[,value2[,value3...] 	# scalar value or vector of values separated by ","
KEY1=value4							# same key can be specified multiple times, value is appended to vector
KEY2==col1,col2,col3 				# == means key contains 2 dimesional array; column names are separated by ","
val11,val12,val13					# each line represents row in array, columns values are separated by ","
val21,val22,val23
#									# empty line ends array
==KEY4,KEY5							# if key of 2D array is empty, column names are treated as KEYs, and rows as values
val41,val51							# same as KEY4=val41<line feed>KEY5=val51
val42,val52					
#									# empty line ends array
KEY3=value
KEY2=xx								# error, can't append to array value
#									# (empty line ends message)

									
Example:
log
addres=0001111222
log==txid,time,value
ffac12,140000001,13.24
ffac11,140000002,12.24
ffac32,140000003,93.24
# empty line
time_of_reply=1244234234
# empty line
