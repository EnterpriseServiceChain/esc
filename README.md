Enterprise Service Chain

Enterprise Service Chain (ESC) is a block chain based software tool facilitating high volumes of simple transactions that, in most cases, send tokens between accounts as in other crypto currencies. The name is derived from the concept of the Enterprise Service Bus in which a crypto currency is used as the protocol of communication.

The main features of the Enterprise Service Chain can be summarized as follows:
-	Delegated Proof of Stake as block consensus mechanism to reduce network maintenance costs
-	Small account and transaction identifiers, reduced transaction set and parallel processing of transactions to facilitate high transaction volumes (>100kHz one-one transactions, >1MHz one-many transactions)
-	Nodes are heavily penalized for double spends so most transactions can be trusted almost instantly
-	Small set of VIP nodes responsible for network integrity to facilitate incorporation of slow nodes with reduced transaction processing capabilities
-	Hash of all accounts is part of the block and enables instant synchronization with the block chain
-	Hierarchical organization of accounts and nodes facilitates KYC, AML , eID  supply and governance
-	Dividend payments to account holders and node managers to support the growth of the economy of the ESC system

Current status

The software is currently an academic proof of concept. It does not have a user-friendly class structure. It lacks comments. It has small bugs. It has a long ToDo list, but it can be deployed and tested. An instruction for the deployment will be provided shortly.
